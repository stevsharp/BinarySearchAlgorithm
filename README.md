# Binary Search Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm in C#.

## Overview

Binary Search is a fundamental searching algorithm used to efficiently locate a target value within a sorted sequence of elements. 
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval becomes empty.

## Implementation

The binary search algorithm has been implemented in C#. The main method is `BinarySearch()`, which takes a sorted array and a target value as input parameters and returns the index of the target value if found, or -1 if not found.

csharp
public class BinarySearchAlgorithm
{
    public static int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int target)
    {
        // Implementation of binary search algorithm
        // Returns the index of the target value in the array, or -1 if not found
    }
}
